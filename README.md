### Did your foot slip and you fell here or you just came to check? In both situations, welcome!
I am a high school student having education in Turkiye. My main purpose is to make accessible apps and services without any cost - every single project of mine is free!

I know Turkish and English, this helps me to go global.
I love writing with C# and Kotlin, however, I also write Python. 
From the world, to the world, by the world.
